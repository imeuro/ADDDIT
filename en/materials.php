				<h2>Materials for 3D Printing: A World of Possibilities</h2>
				<p>3D printing has revolutionized the way we design and produce objects. At the heart of this technology are the materials, which determine the physical characteristics and final applications of the finished products.</p>
				<p>The most common materials used in 3D printing are plastics, but metals, resins, and composite materials can also be used. They come in a wide range of types, each with specific properties:</p>

				<h2>The main materials for 3D printing</h2>
				<ul class="tech-list">
				    <li id="PA12"><strong>PA12 (Nylon 12):</strong> is an engineering thermoplastic polymer that has earned a prominent place in the world of 3D printing. Belonging to the nylon family, PA12 offers a unique combination of mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties that make it ideal for a wide range of applications.</li>
				    <li id="PA12GB"><strong>PA12GB:</strong> is a variant of polyamide 12 (PA12) with high viscosity. "GB" stands for "Glass Bead," indicating that the material is reinforced with glass beads.</li>
				    <li id="TPU"><strong>TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane):</strong> is a highly appreciated 3D printing material for its flexibility and elasticity. Often referred to as the "rubber" of the 3D printing world, TPU offers a wide range of creative and application possibilities.</li>
				    <li id="PolimeriCaricati"><strong>Filled Polymers:</strong> A filled polymer is a material composed of a polymer matrix (such as PLA, ABS, nylon) to which particles, called fillers, are added. These fillers can be of different nature, such as: Fibers (Carbon, glass, aramid), Minerals (Alumina, talc), Metals (Aluminum, copper), Ceramics (Silicon, silicon carbide)</li>
				    <li id="TPA"><strong>TPA:</strong> Similar to SLA, but uses a UV light source projected onto an entire surface to solidify the resin. It offers a higher printing speed compared to SLA.</li>
				    <li id="ABS"><strong>ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene):</strong> Known for its strength and hardness, it is ideal for functional prototypes and objects that require a certain robustness.</li>
				    <li id="Nylon"><strong>Nylon:</strong> is an engineering thermoplastic polymer widely used in 3D printing for its excellent mechanical and chemical properties. There are different types of nylon, each with specific characteristics.</li>
				    <li id="Inconel625"><strong>Inconel 625:</strong> is a superalloy with high resistance to corrosion and high temperatures, commonly used in sectors such as aerospace, nuclear energy, and the chemical industry. While 3D printing of Inconel 625 presents some challenges, it is possible with advanced technologies and specialized materials.</li>
				    <li id="acciaio17-4PH"><strong>17-4 PH Stainless Steel:</strong> is a precipitation-hardened martensitic stainless steel, known for its excellent mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. It offers a combination of strength, hardness, and corrosion resistance. It is ideal for applications requiring reliable and durable components.</li>
				</ul>
